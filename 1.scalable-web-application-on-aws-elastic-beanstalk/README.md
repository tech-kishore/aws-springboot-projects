# Project Title: Scalable Web Application on AWS Elastic Beanstalk

## Objective: Create a web application using Java and Spring Boot and deploy it on AWS Elastic Beanstalk for easy scalability and management.

## Project Steps:

**Application Setup:**
1. Set up a Java development environment and ensure you have Spring Boot installed.
2. Initialize a new Spring Boot project using Spring Initializr or your preferred IDE.
3. Define the necessary dependencies for building a web application, such as Spring Web, Thymeleaf (for front-end templates), and Spring Data JPA (for data access).

**Implement Application Features:**
1. Define the main features of your web application. For example, it could be an e-commerce platform with product listing, shopping cart, and user authentication functionalities.
2. Design the data models for products, users, and orders, and create corresponding Java entities with JPA annotations.
3. Implement RESTful APIs for CRUD operations to manage products and orders.
4. Develop front-end views using Thymeleaf templates to display product listings, user profiles, and shopping cart contents.

**Local Testing:**
1. Test the application locally on your development machine to ensure it works as expected.
2. Use an embedded database like H2 for local testing, but keep in mind that you will later switch to a managed database on AWS.
   
**AWS Elastic Beanstalk Setup:**
1. Log in to your AWS Management Console and navigate to Elastic Beanstalk.
2. Create a new Elastic Beanstalk application and environment for your Java application.
3. Choose the appropriate platform for Java and select the latest supported Java version.
4. Upload your Java Spring Boot application package (a JAR or WAR file) to Elastic Beanstalk.

**Database Setup:**
1. Choose the preferred managed database service on AWS, such as Amazon RDS for MySQL or PostgreSQL.
2. Create a new database instance for your application and configure the necessary security groups and access credentials.
   
**Configuration and Environment Variables:**
1. Configure the Elastic Beanstalk environment variables to connect your application to the database securely.
2. Set environment variables for any other configurable parameters in your application, such as API keys or secret keys.

**Load Testing and Auto Scaling:**
1. Set up a load testing mechanism to simulate user traffic on your web application.
2. Monitor the performance of your application and ensure it can handle increased traffic.
3. Enable auto scaling on Elastic Beanstalk to automatically adjust the number of instances based on the traffic load.

**Continuous Integration and Deployment (Optional):**
1. Integrate your code repository (e.g., GitHub or AWS CodeCommit) with AWS CodePipeline for automated continuous integration and deployment to Elastic Beanstalk.

**Security and Permissions:**
1. Configure appropriate security settings for your application, including AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles and security groups.
2. Implement SSL/TLS encryption to secure data transmission between clients and the application.

**Monitoring and Logging:**
1. Set up AWS CloudWatch to monitor your application's performance and receive alerts for any potential issues.
2. Configure logging for your application to record important events and errors for debugging purposes.

**Testing on the Elastic Beanstalk Environment:**
1. Deploy your application to the AWS Elastic Beanstalk environment.
2. Test the application on the Elastic Beanstalk environment to ensure it works correctly with the AWS infrastructure.

**Documentation and Presentation:**
1. Create a detailed project documentation that includes the architecture, setup instructions, and key features of your web application.
2. Prepare a presentation summarizing the project's objectives, challenges faced, and solutions implemented.
